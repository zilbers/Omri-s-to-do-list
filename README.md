## App includes
- The web app should have a heading
- The web app should have two sections: Control section and View section
- The control section is where the user adds his todo task and priority, and should have three elements:
  - [\<input\>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) with id `textInput`.
  - [\<select\>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) with id `prioritySelector` (options will be: 1-5).
  - [\<button\>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button) with id `addButton`.
- The View section is where we display the list of added todo tasks and data and should start empty. Each added todo should be inserted to the list.
- After the user click on add button you need to "reset" the input value
- Every todo item should have "container" div with class `todoContainer` that will contain 3 elements:
  - An element with a class `todoText` with the text of the todo task
  - An element with a class `todoCreatedAt` that will hold the creation time of the task in a [SQL format](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_dates.asp#:~:text=SQL%20Date%20Data%20Types&text=DATE%20%2D%20format%20YYYY%2DMM%2D,YEAR%20%2D%20format%20YYYY%20or%20YY)
  - An element for showing the numeric priority of the task, with a class `todoPriority`
